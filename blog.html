            <h2 align="center">The importence Of Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Your mental health is an important part of your well-being. This aspect of your welfare determines how you’re able to operate psychologically, emotionally, and socially among others. Considering how much of a role your mental health plays in each aspect of your life, it's important to guard and improve psychological wellness using appropriate measures. Because different circumstances can affect your mental health, we’ll be highlighting risk factors and signs that may indicate mental distress. But most importantly, we’ll dive into all of the benefits of having your mental health in its best shape.</p>
            <h3>Risk Factors for Poor Mental Health</h3>
            <p>Mental health is described as a state of well-being where a person is able to cope with the normal stresses of life. This state permits productive work output and allows for meaningful contributions to society.

                However, different circumstances exist that may affect the ability to handle life’s curveballs. These factors may also disrupt daily activities, and the capacity to manage these changes. 
                
                The following factors, listed below, may affect mental well-being and could increase the risk of developing psychological disorders.
                </p>
            <h4>Childhood Abuse</h4>
            <p>When a child is subjected to physical assault, sexual violence, emotional abuse, or neglect while growing up, it can lead to severe mental and emotional distress.

                Abuse increases the risk of developing mental disorders like depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or personality disorders.
                
                Children who have been abused may eventually deal with alcohol and substance use issues. But beyond mental health challenges, child abuse may also lead to medical complications such as diabetes, stroke, and other forms of heart disease.
                </p>
            <h4>The Environment</h4>
            <p>A strong contributor to mental well-being is the state of a person’s usual environment. Adverse environmental circumstances can cause negative effects on psychological wellness.

                For instance, weather conditions may influence an increase in suicide cases. Likewise, experiencing natural disasters firsthand can increase the chances of developing PTSD. In certain cases, air pollution may produce negative effects on depression symptoms.
                
                In contrast, living in a positive social environment can provide protection against mental challenges.</p>
            <h3>Signs of Mental Health Problems</h3>
            <p>When mental health is compromised, it isn’t always apparent to the individual or those around them. However, there are certain warning signs to look out for, that may signify negative changes for the well-being. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A switch in eating habits, whether over or undereating</li>
                    <li>A noticeable reduction in energy levels</li>
                    <li>Being more reclusive and shying away from others</li>
                    <li>Feeling persistent despair</li>
                    <li>Indulging in alcohol, tobacco, or other substances more than usual</li>
                    <li>Experiencing unexplained confusion, anger, guilt, or worry</li>
                    <li>Severe mood swings</li>
                    <li>Picking fights with family and friends</li>
                    <li>Hearing voices with no identifiable source</li>
                    <li>Thinking of self-harm or causing harm to others</li>
                    <li>Being unable to perform daily tasks with ease</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Benefits of Good Mental Health</h3>
            <p>Whether young or old, the importance of mental health for total well-being cannot be overstated. When psychological wellness is affected, it can cause negative behaviors that may not only affect personal health but can also compromise relationships with others. 

                Below are some of the benefits of good mental health.</p>
            <h4>A Stronger Ability to Cope With Life’s Stressors</h4>
            <p>When mental and emotional states are at peak levels, the challenges of life can be easier to overcome.

                Where alcohol/drugs, isolation, tantrums, or fighting may have been adopted to manage relationship disputes, financial woes, work challenges, and other life issues—a stable mental state can encourage healthier coping mechanisms.</p>
            <h4>A Positive Self-Image</h4>
            <p>Mental health greatly correlates with personal feelings about oneself. Overall mental wellness plays a part in your self-esteem. Confidence can often be a good indicator of a healthy mental state.

                A person whose mental health is flourishing is more likely to focus on the good in themselves. They will hone in on these qualities, and will generally have ambitions that strive for a healthy, happy life.</p>
            <h3>How to Maintain Mental Health and Well-Being</h3>
            <p>Because mental health is so important to general wellness, it is important that you take care of your mental health.

                To keep mental health in shape, a few introductions to and changes to lifestyle practices may be required. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Taking up regular exercise</li>
                    <li>Prioritizing rest and sleep on a daily basis</li>
                    <li>Trying meditation</li>
                    <li>Learning coping skills for life challenges</li>
                    <li>Keeping in touch with loved ones</li>
                    <li>Maintaining a positive outlook on life</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 align="center">The Power Of Positive Thinking</h2>
            <p>Positive thinking refers to the idea that you can affect your outcome through positive affirmations, self-talk, and visualizations. It’s an idea that many people across different industries, including healthcare, have adopted to one degree or another.

                Though many people promote it for various health benefits, evidence suggests that it may not be as powerful as some people suggest. Still, it may help with reducing anxiety and stress.</p>
            <h3>What is positive thinking?</h3>
            <p>Positive thinking is an act of replacing negative thought patterns, often thought of as pessimism, with positive thought patterns, often thought of as optimism.

                To achieve positive thinking, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repeat constant affirmations</li>
                    <li>Envision success</li>
                    <li>Create happy thoughts to block out stressful or unpleasant thoughts</li>
                    <li>Say good things to yourself to build self-esteem</li>
                </ul>
            <p>A 2019 articleTrusted Source notes that positive thinking suggests that you need to replace all negative thoughts and feelings with positive ones in order to accomplish anything good and pursue happiness. But the author of the article notes that there are several limitations to positive thinking.</p>
            <h3>How to have positive thoughts</h3>
            <p>Positive thinking can’t be practiced without acknowledging the reality of what you’re experiencing and feeling.

                According to a 2020 study, grounding positive thinking in reality and setting reasonable expectations can improve your overall well-being.
                
                When practicing positive thinking consider taking time to observe your thoughts and feelings by practicing somatic therapy exercises, like self-regulation or body scanning.
                
                This can help you ground yourself and acknowledge how your observations are affecting you in the present moment. Try to allow yourself to experience any emotions that come up, such as sadness or anger.
                
                You can then set realistic expectations without denying yourself emotions that may naturally arise when going through difficult situations.</p>
            <h3>How can I train my mind to be positive? </h3>
            <p>Thinking positively can take practice, particularly if you naturally have a more pessimistic view of the world around you.

                Some tricks you can try to help you focus on more positive thinking include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>be open to laughter and smiling even during stressful, sad, or otherwise unpleasant situations</li>
                    <li>take time to check in with your thoughts and try to put positive spins on negative thought patterns</li>
                    <li>look for friends who share a positive viewpoint of the world around them</li>
                    <li>take time to exercise regularly and eat a healthful diet</li>
                    <li>practice positive self-talk, affirmations, and positive imagery
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Benefits of positive thinking </h3>
            <p>The benefits of positive thinking may differ for people. You also may find that it’s easier to achieve with practice. Some possible benefits of positive thinking include:</p>
            <h4>1. Stress and anxiety management</h4>
            <p>A 2021 studyTrusted Source found similar results in people undergoing kidney dialysis. In their controlled study, researchers found that positive thinking helped to reduce anxiety and stress in the study group compared to the control group.

                They also noted that perceived quality of life scores also increased. But depression scores remained the same.</p>
            <h4>2. Improved quality of life</h4>
            <p>Worrying can negatively impact your quality of life and lead to mental health issues, such as high-stress levels, overwhelm, or burnout.

                According to a 2016 studyTrusted Source, replacing distressing thoughts with positive ideation has a beneficial effect and provides an effective replacement for worry.</p>
            <h4>3. Better thinking</h4>
            <p>In a 2017 study, researchers looked at student outcomes when exposed to positive thinking.

                In the controlled experiment, the students in the study group showed increased creative thinking and reduced stress compared to the control group that didn’t engage in positive thinking.</p>
            <h3>Takeaway</h3>
            <p>Positive thinking can help with stress management, worry, and improving the way you think. By extension, it may have positive effects on other aspects of health due to stress’ role in several diseases and mental health conditions.

                Positive thinking involves focusing on the positives and replacing negative thoughts with a more optimistic outlook. This can include positive self-talk, positive imagery, and building self-esteem.</p>

            <blockquote style=" font-style: italic;

            margin: 0 0 20px;">"Open up to the point of view (POV) that ‘Twice as much ain’t twice as good’ if you’re looking for simple happy living"</blockquote>
            <p>I possess little and I love that!

                ­­­­Like everybody else, fiery billboard promotions and zealous hype had left me chasing dreams of possessing car and clothes. This was all the while I was working in a job that I hated, so that I could buy stuff I really didn’t need in the first place!
                <br><br>
                It was not long before eventually the things I owned ended up owing me instead. It wasn’t as good as I’d hoped! Sometimes it was overwhelming and would leave me feeling gutted.
                <br><br>
                It’s hard to remember when I first took the decision to intentionally live with fewer possessions. I suppose it was born quite a few years back mainly out of growing discontent with my screwy conception about life’s purpose.
                <br><br>
                Everything sulked and felt like slipping away. And all the while I was all kinda busy woefully wishing for a better and happier life. As the size of my home grew so did the number of things stuffed into closets. I was spending more and more time caring for everything I possessed.
                <br><br>
                While cleaning stowage one Sunday morning, it struck me hard; how much of my life was being stolen by things that I own? Wasn’t I neglecting things that meant the most to me as a result? It was touchy, perhaps a bit nasty too but from that moment I decided to break free. Next I began to get rid of the non essentials.
                <br><br>
                I had decided to own less!
                <br><br>
                Ever since I figured it out and chose to settle with less, I’ve been experiencing countless benefits; more time for me, more money, more freedom, more energy; all with less stress and distraction. Fewer possessions and a careful use of resources have provided me with the opportunity to follow my greatest passions. It’s great!
                <br><br>
                And I’ve figured it out; I’ll never go back to the way I’ve lived so far. For me that lifestyle is bootless now. Interestingly, along the way I’ve discovered something even better than owning less; wanting less is not foolish and is definitely a better way to make a fresh start.
                <br><br>
                You may ask; if all that was so unnecessary what pushed me to catch up with ‘simple is more’ idea. All I had known so far was that ‘more than, less than or equal to’ are the inequalities meant to represent the relation between two numbers or two expressions. No more!
                <br><br>
                This is how it all began to happen one fine morning.
                <br><br>
                The other day, I was visiting my neighbor at his home just across the street. We were childhood buddies and it’s been awhile since we had last met; so the warmth flew free. Fireside chat soon changed to heart- to- heart gab.
                <br><br>
                I was taken aback for a moment when he confided how anxious he was about the upcoming weekend. “Why?” I asked. “Well, I’m having some new friends coming over for dinner and I’m embarrassed about the size of my house. The last time I went to one of theirs, it was huge and beautiful and gorgeously decorated. Probably one of nicest I ‘d ever laid my eyes on”. Now I know why he looked so edgy and sounded hollow. Obviously, he was sizing himself up and feeling awkward in his own house!
                <br><br>
                I felt a bit sad for him. Graciously, I said what I needed to say; that he had nothing to worry about, that things will be just fine, that his house was big enough and that what matters above all is the feeling you get when you enter a home which is far more important than square footage or the marquee furniture.
                <br><br>
                It’s hard to tell if that was any relief to him. I guess, that’s the least comfort I could have offered to someone who’s disappointed or miserable over something as unimportant as the bigness of his house!
                <br><br>
                Later as I left his place I felt downhearted. What a crummy way to live; always eyeing the possessions of others and equating them to your own! There’s no joy here; this way of living sucks and outlook on life is disparaging. Discontent and envy only make matters worse.
                <br><br>
                Both my friend and the spite that haunted him were a weak match to wish for a full life. Still, I couldn’t fully disassociate myself from what I had experienced during his telling of the story.
                <br><br>
                I had lived in smaller home years ago as well and couldn’t be happier with my life then. I had never wished for a bigger one. I’d often walk past a lot many in the neighborhood all the time and coyly say to myself, “I’m sure glad I don’t have it else I’d be spending so much time and energy taking care of that big pile!” The benefits of being in a smaller home were just great!
                <br><br>
                Soon thereafter, we moved into our ancestral house. It was a big deal; open space, room for everybody, patio, small patch of green — just about everything in it appeared larger and much bigger. Life was perhaps hinting at better.
                <br><br>
                But this is when I began to reflect on how much everything else has changed and wondered how unattractive the constant pursuit of material possessions means to me. Somehow not only I wanted to own less, I wanted less. May be then this would be a wonderful place to be in, I’d confide in me. I’d feel comforted and reassured.
                <br><br>
                Today because I don’t want to own more than I already have, I am finally free from the constant collating of my stuff to others. I am no longer tormented by an incessant pursuit for more money and more stuff. I have found contentment in the things that I own. And above all I have discovered more room for generosity.
                <br><br>
                Because I don’t want to possess anymore than I already have, I am free from constant contemplation. I am no longer bound to the incessant pursuit of more money and more belongings.
                <br><br>
                I have found peace, contentment and happiness in the things that I possess. It has also served me with extra space to indulge and be openhearted in giving.
                <br><br>
                I have finally found my stride and begun to bend my pursuits towards things that matter. It’s no more a race to have it all.
                <br><br>
                Things no longer define me as an individual.
                <br><br>
                I’ve stopped buying stuff, knowing that it will only burden me and add to my worries. I’m content with what I’ve got now, because I know that more doesn’t necessarily guarantee joy or happiness.
                <br><br>
                To me it’s a great feeling living with less and… wanting less even better!</p>
